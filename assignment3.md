## Cleaning Steps
One of the cleaning steps I needed to take was to consolidate the vote column. Their are various classifications like early voting, and mail voting, but ultimately I just needed total votes to see which counties produce the most total votes.

### Data Question
Which counties in Florida are producing the most votes?

#### Answer to Data Question
The answer is Miami-Dade County produces the most votes by far, even serving as a super county with over 566,000 votes in 2018. Palm Beach county follows with 86,000 votes and Broward county is in third with 52,000 votes.
