# Summary
Vox has conducted detailed reporting and research on how Florida is changing, and one article, "How Florida became the center of the Republican Universe"
In summary, Vox identifies three major factors that contribute to Florida becoming more Republican. And they do definitely think Florida is increasingly a "red state."
Vox cites how every partisan statewide office is held by a Republican, and the closest Democrats have come to winning the governorship was in 2018.
Desantis winning the governorship by 20 points in 2022 solidifies Florida's turn to being a red state, as well as the redistricting that makes Florida's congressional map much more favorable to Republicans.
The three factors that contribute to Florida becoming more Republican include increasing strength of Florida's Republican Party, the subsequent collapse of the Democratic party in Florida, and finally that Hispanic voters seem to be trending toward the Republican party in the state.

-Florida's Republican Party is stronger as evidenced by better fundraising, stronger voter registration efforts, and most new arrivals in the state registering as Republicans.

-FLorida's Democratic Party is weaker as evidenced by lagging fundraising, lagging voter registration, and low national investment in the party.

-Finally, it seems according to exit polls, that Hispanic voters are trending away from voting Democrat, and these voters are important to winning Florida.

## What Vox Leaves Out
Vox leaves out the way counties in Florida are trending. I think my analysis can differ by going county by county and showing where Republicans are now overperforming, and if Democrats are doing better in some areas than they do historically.
I think if I compile exit polling data to show how demographics are voting in Florida, with county election results and county demographics, I think I can paint a more detailed picture of how different parts of Florida are voting.

### The Hill and FiveThirtyEight

An article from The Hill also reports about how the pandemic may have helped catalyze the shift toward Republicans.

Finally, FiveThirtyEight overviews the voter turnout gap in elections between 2012 and 2022, with the turnout gap in 2022 between Democrats and Republicans being the largest it has ever been.
FiveThirtyEight's article does a good job showing statewide turnout in big governor and presidential elections.

But once again, both articles leave out county by county changes over time, as well as comparing county changes overtime and broader demographic changes over time.

I think there is room to narrow down the question. So, I may refine my pitch to how are Florida counties changing demographically and politically? Does this explain a political shift to the Republicans?
