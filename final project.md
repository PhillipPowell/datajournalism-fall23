# Introduction
With Governor Ron Desantis’ nearly 20% point win over Democrat challenger Charlie Crist in 2022, many are wondering how Florida–which was once decided by a few hundred votes in 2000– is now voting so strongly for Republicans. 

Before Desantis’ huge win, Donald Trump carried the state in 2020 over Biden by 3.3%, improving on his margin in 2016 and being the first losing presidential candidate to win the state since 1992.

Florida holds a statewide election every two years, because in years the presidential race is not on the ballot, the gubernatorial  race is on the ballot, providing plenty of county by county voting data to use.

## Nutgraph
According to past election results, since the 1990s Florida has tended to deliver Republicans statewide victories, but statewide elections have also been within 4% from 2008 to 2022. 

Governor Ron Desantis’ landslide 2022 victory suggested Florida is shifting toward Republicans, and his win can be attributed to Republicans making gains in Miami-Dade county and Florida’s five other largest counties where Democrats used to get most of their votes. At the same time, registered voter data suggests Hispanic voters in Miami-Dade county, where they are the majority, are shifting from Democrat to Republican, further suggesting Florida may be trending more toward the Republican party. 

Finally, a significant turnout gap exists between Desantis’ landslide in 2022 and the 2018 and 2020 elections. If the turnout gap can largely be attributed to Democrats choosing to stay home in the six largest counties, then Florida may not be as red as Desantis’ victory made it look in 2022.

Before 2022, the last seven statewide elections in Florida were decided by less than 4%, regardless of how high voter turnout was, in presidential years and gubernatorial years. By that fact alone, Florida would appear to be a swing state.

**Graph 1**

But, according to 270toWin, Democrats haven’t won the governor’s race since 1994, though many races have been close. And aside from Barack Obama’s wins in 2008 and 2012, since the 1990s, Democrats have only won the presidential race in 1996. 

Florida’s broader electoral history shows that the state has always tilted a bit toward Republicans in the modern era, but elections tended to be very close. Ron Desantis himself only won his first term as Florida Governor in 2018 by 0.4%, or by about 32,000 votes across the state.

That changed with Ron Desantis’ huge 19.4% reelection victory, where he won by 1.5 million votes. How did Desantis do it? The answer largely lies in the election results of Florida’s six largest counties (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Hillsborough, Orange, and Duval).

**Graph 2**

Miami-Dade, the largest county in Florida, has been won by huge margins by the Democrat candidate in the last seven elections. Across the country, Democrats tend to do very well in cities and metropolitan areas while Republicans do better in rural areas.

In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county 63%-34% over Donald Trump, and in 2018 Desantis lost the county, winning only 38% of the vote there.

But in 2020, Trump improved his margin to 46% of the vote and Desantis became the first Republican to win a majority of the county’s vote since Jeb Bush in 2002, winning 55% in 2022.

Miami-Dade has shifted toward the Republicans in the last two elections, but the other large counties in Florida also show troubling signs for Democrats' ability to win statewide.

**Graph 3**

Home to Orlando, Broward county has always produced huge margins for Democrats. But like Miami-Dade, the county started shifting toward the Republicans in 2020. 

Trump improved his vote total in 2020 by 4% from 2016, and Desantis improved his vote total from 2018 by 10% in his 2022 win.

**Graph 4**

Desantis also flipped Palm Beach County in 2022, a county that Clinton won by 15% in 2016. In 2020, Trump improved on his 2016 performance by 3% and in 2022, Desantis won by 4% after losing by 17% in 2018.

**Graph 5**

Hillsborough county has historically been far closer than Palm Beach and Miami-Dade, but Democrats counted on winning it. Desantis also flipped the county in 2022 after Trump improved the margins for Republicans in 2020.

**Graph 6**

The story in Orange county is more similar to Broward county, but it still bodes poorly for Democrats trying to win the state. Since 2016, the county has voted more and more Republican and in 2022 Desantis lost by 7% after losing the first time around by 24%.

**Graph 7**

Finally, Duval county, the home of Jacksonville has historically been the closest large county in Florida. Trump even lost the county in 2020 after winning in 2016, and it looked like Jacksonville was trending toward the Democrats. But in 2022, Desantis won by 12% after Biden won by 3% in 2020.

Republican gains in big cities along with their base of support in rural areas contributed to Desantis’ overwhelming win in 2022.

Voter turnout was much lower in 2022 than in 2020, but the difference in the margin is still striking.

**Graph 8**

Before Desantis’ win in 2022, Republicans were gaining registered voters and registered Hispanic voters in Miami-Dade throughout the year. On the other hand, Democrats were losing registered voters.

**Graph 9**

Before the election in 2022, Hispanic voters made up 59% of the electorate, and Democrats were losing ground with them as Republicans were gaining. 

The marginal shifts in voter registration cannot explain why Democrats did so poorly in Miami-Dade in 2022, as they still hold an advantage in total registered voters in the county. But, Hispanic voters shifting toward the Republican party is part of the story of whether Florida is trending Republican.

**Graph 10**

Finally, in 2022 turnout was lower than in the past two election cycles. In 2018 turnout was almost 10% higher than in 2022, so there is the outstanding question of what Democratic voter turnout looked like compared to Republican voter turnout. 

If the turnout difference is largely attributed to Democrats staying home, then Florida is probably not as red as Desantis’ win makes it look. Reporting by NBC 6 South Florida, also indicates that in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Hillsborough, and Duval counties, registered Democrats turned out at a much lower rate than registered Republicans in those counties.

#### Future Plans for Story
To complete this story in the future, I would want to take four steps:

I would spend more time analyzing the change in registered voters, especially registered Hispanic voters, in the other five biggest counties in Florida. While Hispanic voters are a majority in Miami-Dade, they are an important voting group across Florida and if they are shifting to the Republicans more broadly that could be more evidence Florida is trending Republican.

I would want to interview the former Chair of the Democratic Party, Manny Diaz, who resigned over Democrats loss in 2022, and other volunteers and members of the party to get a better understanding of why Democrats did so poorly.

I would want to interview Democratic and Republican voters in Miami-Dade county to get more qualitative evidence about the county’s shift to the Republicans in 2022.

I would want to focus more on whether Florida is becoming more conservative, thus trending more Republican, or if Desantis’ landslide win can be more attributed to Democrats staying home and the failures of the Florida Democratic Party.

##### Steps to Analyze Data
First, I created my spreadsheet by downloading data from the Florida Department of State Division of Elections on voter turnout, total voters, and county by county election results from 2008 to 2022.

After calculating voter turnout in Florida’s six largest counties, I then began deciding how I wanted to present the data visually and what the biggest takeaways were from the data including that the six most populous counties in Florida shifted toward the Republicans.

I downloaded data from the Miami-Dade County Election Results Archive on voter registration over the 10 months leading up to the November, 2022 election. I saw that Republicans were increasing voter registration while Democrats were losing registered voters in the county.

I made the column charts using Excel.
