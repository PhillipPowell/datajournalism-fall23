# Introduction
With Governor Ron Desantis’ nearly 20% point win over Democrat challenger Charlie Crist in 2022, many are wondering how Florida–which was once decided by a few hundred votes in 2000– is now voting so strongly for Republicans. 

Before Desantis’ huge win, Donald Trump carried the state in 2020 over Biden by 3.3%, improving on his margin in 2016 and being the first losing candidate to win the state since 1992.

Florida holds a statewide election every two years, because in years the presidential race is not on the ballot, the gubernatorial  race is on the ballot, providing plenty of county by county voting data to use.

## Nutgraph
According to past election results, since the 1990s Florida has tended to deliver Republicans statewide victories, but statewide elections have also been within 4% from 2008 to 2022. 

Governor Ron Desantis’ landslide 2022 victory suggested Florida is shifting toward Republicans, and his win can be attributed to Republicans making gains in Miami-Dade county and Florida’s five other largest counties where Democrats used to get most of their votes. At the same time, registered voter data suggests Hispanic voters in Miami-Dade county, where they are the majority, are shifting from Democrat to Republican, further suggesting Florida may be trending more toward the Republican party. 

Finally, a significant turnout gap exists between Desantis’ landslide in 2022 and the 2018 and 2020 elections. If the turnout gap can largely be attributed to Democrats choosing to stay home in the six largest counties, then Florida may not be as red as Desantis’ victory made it look in 2022.
