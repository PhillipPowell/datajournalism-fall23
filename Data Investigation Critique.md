## Data Critique
[Data Critique}(https://www.lpm.org/news/2020-12-07/despite-voting-restoration-thousands-are-still-disenfranchised-in-the-ohio-valley)
### Clarity and Accuracy

Central Insight = 4

More than 5 million people in the United States are disenfranchised because of past felonies, and Kentucky has 200,000 people disenfranchised because of past felonies. 50,000 people in Ohio still remain disenfranchised due to a past felony conviction and 15,000 people in West Virginia are also disenfranchised due to a past felony conviction. The central insight was summarized in the headline.

Data Visualization = N/A

There was no data visualization tool used in the story.

Data Accuracy = 5

The data used in the story is mostly from the sentencing project, which upon further research seems to be a very credible source of data. The reporter did a great job finding anecdotal stories that matched the data to put a human face on the data; however, I think the reporter should have checked with the state government's of Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia to verify the numbers the Sentencing Project is reporting. Perhaps the reporter could have sent a FOIA to the state-level department of corrections or developed a source there in each of the states.

#### Quality

Execution = 4

The story is well written and it weaves data with perspectives from formerly incarcerated individuals in The Ohio Valley on their disenfranchisement and how it affects them. I think the reporter could have created a graphic to better summarize what the data shows about disenfranchized felons. Maybe the reporter could have included the felons demographic data, or what types of crimes many of these disenfranchized felons committeed. I think adding that data could give the reader a better idea of who is affected and why.

##### Creativity

Creativity Effectiveness = 2

The story did not include many creative visual elements. There was a photo of Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signing an executive order to give felons voting rights back, but there are no photos of the subjects interviewed. The data is told to the reader, but not shown in the form of a graphic or table. So, visually, I think the story is lacking and could have incorporated more interesting visual elements to draw a reader in.
